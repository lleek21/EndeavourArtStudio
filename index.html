                <h2>About me</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Endeavour Art studio and Gallery is an independant gallery and working studio based in North Yorkshire, where imagination is brought to life through brush and canvas. </p>
                <br>
                <p>As the resident artist, I create original works using acrylic, oils, and watercolours on both canvas and watercolour paper. Every painting is personally produced and sold directly by me.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A particular interest of mine is creating artwork for children - from adventurous pirate scenes to magical fairy forests.</p>
                <br>
